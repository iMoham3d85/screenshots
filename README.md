Screenshots of ownCloud software

The master branch always has the latest stable release (or, shortly before a new release is out, the upcoming one...). Older versions can be found in branches.

If some image is missing or still old, contributions are welcome! Please observe these rules for making screenshots:

* Don't include browser URL bar and bookmarks and such - crop images to JUST ownCloud! So, no distractions or platform-specific stuff.
* Size/resolution: widescreen 1280x720 pixels. This makes them look good even if shown as thumbnail or printed in a magazine)
  * this means you have to size the viewport to this resolution, not the entire browser window ;-)
* To remove personal information, use Gimp's Pixelize filter: select the area(s) you'd like to clean up and use the filter with 5x5 blocks.
* Include a nice name and avatar image. cats, monkeys... be creative.
* All shots full screen, please don't crop them. That can be done later if needed.

Enjoy!
